Question: Explain the z index with example code?
Ans: z-index is the CSS property that controls the stacking order of overlapping elements on a page. An element with a higher z-index value will appear in front of an element with a lower z-index value. The property is called “z-index” because it sets the order of elements along the z-axis.

Example code:
 img {
  z-index: -1;
}
In above example img tag with z index -1.
